# Attendance-Management-System-Using-Barcode-Scanner
The proposed solution offers a Barcode  for the attendees to scan it via a specific application. The Barcode along with the attendeeâ€™s identity taken by the application will confirm his attendance.Every student is provided with a idcard containing a unique barcode. Each barcode represents a unique id of students. Students just have to scan their cards using barcode scanner and the system notes down their attendance.
